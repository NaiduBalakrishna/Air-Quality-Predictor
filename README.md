# Air Quality Checker

This project is a simple Air Quality Checker web application that allows users to check air quality based on latitude and longitude coordinates. The application fetches real-time air quality data from the RapidAPI Air Quality API and displays the relevant air pollution data including AQI, CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 levels.

# Demo

To see the application in action, enter latitude and longitude coordinates and click on "Check Air Quality." The results will show air quality data for the location.

# Features

Input latitude and longitude to retrieve real-time air quality data.
Displays levels of various pollutants including:
AQI (Air Quality Index)
CO (Carbon Monoxide)
NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide)
O3 (Ozone)
PM2.5 (Particulate Matter smaller than 2.5 microns)
PM10 (Particulate Matter smaller than 10 microns)
SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide)

# Usage

Enter the latitude and longitude coordinates in the input fields.
Click on the "Check Air Quality" button.
The air quality data will be fetched from the API and displayed on the screen.
